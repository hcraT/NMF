\title{Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient}
\usage{
cophcor(object, ...)

\S4method{cophcor}{matrix}(object, linkage = "average")
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object from which is extracted a consensus matrix.}

\item{...}{extra arguments to allow extension and passed to subsequent calls.}

\item{linkage}{linkage method used in the hierarchical clustering.
It is passed to \code{\link{hclust}}.}
}
\description{
The function \code{cophcor} computes the cophenetic correlation coefficient
from consensus matrix \code{object}, e.g. as obtained from multiple NMF runs.
}
\details{
The cophenetic correlation coeffificient is based on the consensus matrix
(i.e. the average of connectivity matrices) and was proposed by
Brunet et al. (2004) to measure the stability of the clusters obtained from NMF.

It is defined as the Pearson correlation between the samples' distances
induced by the consensus matrix (seen as a similarity matrix) and their
cophenetic distances from a hierachical clustering based on these very
distances (by default an average linkage is used).
See Brunet et al. (2004).
