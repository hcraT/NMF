\title{Testing Equality of NMF Models

The function \code{nmf.equal} tests if two NMF models are the same, i.e. they
contain -- almost -- identical data: same basis and coefficient matrices, as
well as same extra parameters.}
\usage{
nmf.equal(x, y, ...)

\S4method{nmf.equal}{NMF,NMF}(x, y, identical = TRUE, ...)

\S4method{nmf.equal}{list,list}(x, y, ..., all = FALSE, vector = FALSE)

\S4method{nmf.equal}{list,missing}(x, y, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an NMF model or an object that is associated with an NMF model, e.g.
the result from a fit with \code{\link{nmf}}.}

\item{y}{an NMF model or an object that is associated with an NMF model, e.g.
the result from a fit with \code{\link{nmf}}.}

\item{...}{extra arguments to allow extension, and passed to subsequent calls}

\item{identical}{a logical that indicates if the comparison should be made
using the function \code{\link{identical}} (\code{TRUE}) or \code{\link{all.equal}}
(\code{FALSE}). See description for method \code{nmf.equal,NMF,NMF}.}

\item{all}{a logical that indicates if all fits should be compared separately
or only the best fits}

\item{vector}{a logical, only used when \code{all=TRUE}, that indicates if
all fits must be equal for \code{x} and \code{y} to be declared equal, or
if one wants to return the result of each comparison in a vector.}

\description{
Testing Equality of NMF Models

The function \code{nmf.equal} tests if two NMF models are the same, i.e. they
contain -- almost -- identical data: same basis and coefficient matrices, as
well as same extra parameters.
}
\details{
\code{nmf.equal} compares two NMF models, and return \code{TRUE} iff they are
identical acording to the function \code{\link{identical}} when \code{identical=TRUE},
or equal up to some tolerance acording to the function \code{\link{all.equal}}.
This means that all data contained in the objects are compared, which includes
at least the basis and coefficient matrices, as well as the extra parameters
stored in slot \sQuote{misc}.

If extra arguments are specified in \code{...}, then the comparison is performed
using \code{\link{all.equal}}, irrespective of the value of argument \code{identical}.

\section{Methods (by generic)}{
\itemize{
\item \code{nmf.equal(x = NMFfit,y = NMF)}: Compares two NMF models when at least one comes from a NMFfit object,
i.e. an object returned by a single run of \code{\link{nmf}}.

\item \code{nmf.equal(x = NMF,y = NMFfit)}: Compares two NMF models when at least one comes from a NMFfit object,
i.e. an object returned by a single run of \code{\link{nmf}}.

\item \code{nmf.equal(x = NMFfit,y = NMFfit)}: Compares two fitted NMF models, i.e. objects returned by single runs of
\code{\link{nmf}}.

\item \code{nmf.equal(x = NMFfitX,y = NMF)}: Compares two NMF models when at least one comes from multiple NMF runs.

\item \code{nmf.equal(x = NMF,y = NMFfitX)}: Compares two NMF models when at least one comes from multiple NMF runs.

\item \code{nmf.equal(x = NMFfitX1,y = NMFfitX1)}: Compares the NMF models fitted by multiple runs, that only kept the best fits.

\item \code{nmf.equal(x = NMF,y = NMF)}: Compares two NMF models.

Arguments in \code{...} are used only when \code{identical=FALSE} and are
passed to \code{all.equal}.

\item \code{nmf.equal(x = list,y = list)}: Compares the results of multiple NMF runs.

This method either compare the two best fit, or all fits separately.
All extra arguments in \code{...} are passed to each internal call to
\code{nmf.equal}.

\item \code{nmf.equal(x = list,y = missing)}: Compare all elements in \code{x} to \code{x[[1]]}.
